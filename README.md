# Employment-Trends-Salary-Distribution analysis using R
This project deals with the analysis of the Baltimore City Employee dataset which can be used to identify and analyze workforce related issues or to check the proportion of residents working at specific agencies. The data also provides the distribution of Annual and Gross Salary of the employees across various departments.

Background Motivation:
Founded in 1700’s, Baltimore City is one of the major cities in Maryland with a population of 570,000 (estimated in 2021). The city’s council provides its employed citizens with various services. 
To continue providing these services, the council has been collecting and maintaining a large warehouse of data like name of employees, agency they are hired in, their designations, annual salary and so on. 
This dataset is stored and kept available at their government portal and can be extracted through ADP system. 
The data can be used to identify and analyze workforce related issues or to check the proportion of residents working at specific agencies. The data also reveals the employment cycle of city residents.

Project Proposal:
Analysis of this dataset will provide us with insights and trends on Baltimore city’s salary distribution across the different agencies and fiscal years. 
We will also be comparing hiring duration to the salary distributions to get an insight into variation of pay-grade range among these years. 
Comparing agencies with gross salaries of citizens will help the council to know how salaries are distributed among these agencies. 
We will also showcase the number of employees across each department and how the hiring has changed throughout those years.
We will be using R for data manipulation, analysis and visualization to provide our target audience with accurate and efficient insights of Baltimore city’s workforce.
